Passing notes

I have to write it down twice
because my hand is shaking too much the first time
Jagged torn edges of notebook paper
pressed on the cold tile of my bathroom floor

Folded tightly
two pages in the palm of my hand
slipped through the slats of a locker

We pass notes because some words
can't be said out loud
instead they're thrown into lockers, backpacks
on paper torn from science notes
in scratched out pen
no names
