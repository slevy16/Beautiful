Things I have written (but never shared)

A red USB drive holds
organized folders filled with documents
names like story1 story2 and even story3

Based on a dream I had once
where I woke up with a weight on my chest
because I had been dying slowly
I typed every scene I could remember
And never opened it again

Time travelers with names
that I researched more than I wrote
and an ending I still remember
even though it never happened

Every chapter contains the words
to a song from my iPod
in alphabetical order
I only made it to C

50,017 words, 90 pages
written in one month
just to say I could
I couldn't tell you what it was about
just that it was

Poems and poems and poems
I wrote to avoid saying
certain things out loud
even though they were exploding inside of me
