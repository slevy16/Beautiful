My life through a series of notebooks

A small blue book
with the words "Dumb Diary"
scratched into the front with pen
after a book series I liked

A houndstooth patterned composition book
from fifth grade
a required journal where I wrote about my day
and drew bad stick figure diagrams
and wrote silly song parodies

A red spiral notebook
thinner than average
filled front to back with daily entries
and thoughts and reflections
that I hate to read

The front says CTR on it
it stands for "choose the right"
containing two years of my life
in fading pencil

The cover is ripped off
it was green
the first few pages are blank
the rest covered in days of one sentence phrases
and three page long paragraphs

Black with flowers
mostly empty
