Rejection letters

We regret to inform you...
that you are a failure
you are not good enough
we don't want you

Please know that this decision...
was easy for us
we never wanted you
no one has ever wanted you

Write the word failure on your forehead
burn it into your flesh
scrawl it on every inch of your skin
you are not good enough
you will never be good enough

Sincerely,
Everyone
