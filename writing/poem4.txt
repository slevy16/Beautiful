Happy endings

I read so many books
with happy endings
where even though everything went wrong for a while
it ended up ok

The hero will never die
unless it's a sacrifice
for the greater good
from the first page you know
how it will end

Every story I wrote
I wanted to end in ruin
I had become so used to the hero
saving the day and falling in love
and the villain dead, defeated

I wanted the hero gone
shot in the back of the head
body on the ground

I wanted to scream
you can't have your happy ending
the hero can't always win

It's hard to always see the villain lose
when that's who you feel like you are
