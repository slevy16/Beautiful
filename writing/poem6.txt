Sticks and Stones

Words like darts
piercing your flesh
digging their inky claws into you
slipping through every vein
until the blood runs black beneath your skin

Write the word failure on your forehead
burn it into your flesh
scrawl it on every inch of your skin
you are not good enough
you will never be good enough

Sticks and stones will break your bones
and words will eat your heart
and burrow down into your skin
and fester in your mind and rot you
from the inside out
