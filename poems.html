        A red USB drive holds <br>
        organized folders filled with documents<br>
        names like story1 story2 and even story3<br>
        <br>
        Based on a dream I had once<br>
        where I woke up with a weight on my chest<br>
        because I had been dying slowly<br>
        I typed every scene I could remember<br>
        And never opened it again<br>
        <br>
        Time travelers with names<br>
        that I researched more than I wrote<br>
        and an ending I still remember<br>
        even though it never happened<br>
        <br>
        Every chapter contains the words<br>
        to a song from my iPod<br>
        in alphabetical order<br>
        I only made it to C<br>
        <br>
        50,017 words, 90 pages<br>
        written in one month<br>
        just to say I could<br>
        I couldn't tell you what it was about<br>
        just that it was<br>
        <br>
        Poems and poems and poems<br>
        I wrote to avoid saying<br>
        certain things out loud<br>
        even though they were exploding inside of me

      My life through a series of notebooks
      <div id = '2' style = "display:none">

        A small blue book<br>
        with the words "Dumb Diary"<br>
        scratched into the front with pen<br>
        after a book series I liked<br><br>

        A houndstooth patterned composition book<br>
        from fifth grade<br>
        a required journal where I wrote about my day<br>
        and drew bad stick figure diagrams<br>
        and wrote silly song parodies<br><br>

        A red spiral notebook<br>
        thinner than average<br>
        filled front to back with daily entries<br>
        and thoughts and reflections<br>
        that I hate to read<br><br>

        The front says CTR on it<br>
        it stands for "choose the right"<br>
        containing two years of my life<br>
        in fading pencil<br><br>

        The cover is ripped off<br>
        it was green<br>
        the first few pages are blank<br>
        the rest covered in days of one sentence phrases<br>
        and three page long paragraphs<br><br>

        Black with flowers<br>
        mostly empty<br>

        Happy endings
        <div id = '3' style = "display:none">
          <br>
          I read so many books<br>
          with happy endings<br>
          where even though everything went wrong for a while<br>
          it ended up ok<br><br>

          The hero will never die<br>
          unless it's a sacrifice<br>
          for the greater good<br>
          from the first page you know<br>
          how it will end<br><br>

          Every story I wrote<br>
          I wanted to end in ruin<br>
          I had become so used to the hero<br>
          saving the day and falling in love<br>
          and the villain dead, defeated<br><br>

          I wanted the hero gone<br>
          shot in the back of the head<br>
          body on the ground<br><br>

          I wanted to scream<br>
          you can't have your happy ending<br>
          the hero can't always win<br><br>

          It's hard to always see the villain lose<br>
          when that's who you feel like you are<br>

      Passing Notes

        I have to write it down twice<br>
        because my hand is shaking too much the first time<br>
        Jagged torn edges of notebook paper<br>
        pressed on the cold tile of my bathroom floor<br><br>

        Folded tightly<br>
        two pages in the palm of my hand<br>
        slipped through the slats of a locker<br><br>

        We pass notes because some words<br>
        can't be said out loud<br>
        instead they're thrown into lockers, backpacks<br>
        on paper torn from science notes<br>
        in scratched out pen<br>
        no names<br>
